README

This repository contains the scripts from an analysis of a dataset that contained 10 observations of ~2700 variables from two classes. The scripts here represent part of an analysis that I conducted. These include two forms of logistic regression with built-in sparsity parameters, parametric and nonparametric tests with bootstrapped confidence intervals, linear and non-linear clustering methods, as well as a variety of other plots and formatted tables.
